* use "real" triple implementation : like this : https://github.com/IKS/rdfQuery [1]
** the main issue here is that this implementation don't accept json-ld (turtle and json are okay)
** but this one https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js is a js implementation of json-ld
*** but really lack of documentation and don't see for now how to get triples from here.

[1] the main interresting part is : http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/wiki/RdfPlugin
Note : the git repository is a mirror of this google code, seem to be updated from git to gcode

* get serialisation
** The dump() method can take an options argument which is an object with the following properties:
** format: the format of the dump as a mime type. Possible values are 'application/json' (the default) and 'application/rdf+xml'.
    namespaces: an object defining the namespace bindings that will be used in the dump. This is only relevant for XML-based formats. The prefix rdf is always bound to the RDF syntax namespace. 
** For XML-based formats, the dump() method actually returns a DOM document rather than a string.

* about vie.js
** document for 1.0.0 : http://viejs.org/docs/1.0.0/
