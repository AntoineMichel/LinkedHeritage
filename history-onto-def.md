Change object : 
- if with a from propertie but not a to propertie : current modifications, not take in account for a new version
- if with a from and a to : diffÃ©rence beetween the two versions

diff object :
- if no "old-value" define : equiv to a creation of the element
- if no "new-value" define : equiv to a delection of the element
==> So the "crud" propertie is really usefull ? as couples :
* !old-value && new-value : equiv to create (c)
* old-value && new-value : equiv to update (u)
* old-value && !new-value : equiv to delete (d)

Why a "diff" object : 
- this allow to define, depending on the need to have "atomic" changes (with just one diff) or "changeset" (with multiple diff)
